The Backup Bruteforcer script will ask you for the link to the given file you want to find a backup of. It will ask for the link in parts. This is how you may have to split up a few example links:
https://wordpresswebsite.com/wp-login/login.php :::
  HTTP Host = https://wordpresswebsite.com 
  Directory = /wp-login/
  File = login
  Extension = php

http://customsite.org/www/var/index.html :::
  HTTP Host = http://customsite.org
  Directory = /www/var/
  File = index
  Extension = html

If you still don't get it, read the script source code.

I have not bothered to comment or document the script, so feel free to do so however you like.

There is not an official license for this script. That is because it is a quick and dirty tool anyone could write. It's just meant to be a base for whatever else you might need.

It'd be appreciated if you told everyone here about the changes you make to optimize the script, but that's your choice to do so or not.
